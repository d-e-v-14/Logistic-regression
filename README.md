# Logistic-regression

## Overview
This project develops a clothing item classifier using Logistic Regression to predict the category of clothing items. The model is trained on a dataset of clothing images or attributes and evaluated for accuracy and loss. Additionally, Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are applied to interpret model decisions and feature importance.

## Features
- Preprocessing and normalization of data
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets
- Implementing Logistic Regression using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy and loss metrics
- Applying Explainable AI techniques using `LIME` (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to interpret model decisions

## Libraries Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn (`sklearn`)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
- LIME (for Explainable AI)

## Dataset
The dataset consists of clothing items and their corresponding categories. It should be preprocessed and normalized before feeding into the model.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Load and Preprocess Data**
   - Load the dataset using Pandas
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize numerical features
   - Encode categorical variables if needed
2. **Split Dataset**
   - Divide the dataset into training and testing subsets(80/20)
3. **Train Logistic Regression Model**
   - Implement Logistic Regression using `scikit-learn`
   - Train the model and compute accuracy metrics
4. **Evaluate Performance**
   - Compute accuracy and loss metrics
   - Visualize performance using confusion matrix
   - Visualize the plot between Actual and Predicted values by plotting a linear graph
   - Visualize the plot between Actual and Residual values by plotting a linear graph
5. **Apply Explainable AI Techniques**
   - Use LIME to explain model predictions
   - Interpret feature importance and decision-making

## Results
- Model accuracy and loss will be displayed.
- Feature importance will be visualized using LIME.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different feature engineering techniques
- Optimize hyperparameters for better performance
- Extend to a deep learning-based model for improved accuracy
